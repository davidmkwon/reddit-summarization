- ImTheChampagnePuppy: This looks incredible. Egypt is at the top of my
list of travel destinations. Do you think Alexandria would be a good
spot for someone going to the country for the first time?

    - Lochrann: Personally I would say, if you happen to have extra time
    to kill, go there, but if you're strapped for time, there are dozens
    of places worth seeing before it

    - Cincybus: Do at least two nights in Cairo, if you have extra time visit
      Alexandria, but I wouldn't make it a focal point of the trip.

        - ben_zeen: I'd recommend 3-4 days in Cairo, there's just SO
          MUCH to see there, I could spend Months without getting bored!

    - ben_zeen: Nah, Cairo, Luxor and Abu Simbel should be you rtop
      priority.

Summary:
- Is Alexandria a good spot for someone's first time?
- There are places worth seeing before, visit if you have extra time
- Nah, Cairo, Luxor, and Abu Simbel are recommended
